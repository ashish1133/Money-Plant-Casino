# 🎰 Lucky Casino - Premium Gaming Experience

An end‑to‑end demo casino platform: rich animated frontend + Node.js/Express backend (SQLite) with authentication, wallet, progression (XP & levels), achievements, leaderboards, and provably fair gameplay.

## 🎮 Frontend Features

### Games
| Game | Mechanics | Notes |
|------|-----------|-------|
| Slots | 3 reels, symbol matching | Server authoritative RNG + seed/hash for fairness |
| Roulette | Color bet (red/black/green) | Payouts 2x / 2x / 14x (example) |

## 🔧 Backend Features

- SQLite via better-sqlite3 (fast synchronous queries)
- Auth: JWT access + refresh tokens, secure refresh flow
- Services split by domain (`services/*`): auth, wallet, games, progression, leaderboard
- Provably Fair RNG (`utils/fairRNG.js`): seed + HMAC hash exposure + verification endpoint
- Middleware: authentication, rate limiting, helmet, CORS (multi-origin)
- Structured logging (Winston) & error handling
- Progression and achievement unlocking integrated into game results

## 🌐 API Overview (High Level)
| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/api/auth/register` | POST | Create account (returns tokens) |
| `/api/auth/login` | POST | Authenticate |
| `/api/auth/refresh` | POST | Refresh access token |
| `/api/wallet/deposit` | POST | Add funds |
| `/api/wallet/withdraw` | POST | Remove funds |
| `/api/wallet/transactions` | GET | Paginated transaction list |
| `/api/games/slots` | POST | Play slots round |
| `/api/games/roulette` | POST | Play roulette round |
| `/api/games/blackjack` | POST | Deal / Hit / Stand (action param) |
| `/api/games/verify` | POST | Validate seed/hash combo |
| `/api/users/profile` | GET | User profile + progression snapshot |
| `/api/users/stats` | GET | Aggregated gameplay stats |
| `/api/users/achievements` | GET | Achievement list |
| `/api/users/daily-bonus` | POST | Claim daily bonus |
| `/api/users/leaderboard` | GET | Leaderboard by type/game |

## 🧩 Dynamic API Base URL
Frontend auto-detects backend base via `api-client.js` priority:
1. `window.API_BASE_URL` global (define before scripts)
2. `<meta name="api-base" content="https://your-backend-domain/api">`
3. `localhost` fallback when hostname is `localhost`
4. Same-origin `/api` for combined deployment

Add in `index.html` head for production:
```html
<meta name="api-base" content="https://casino-backend.example/api">
```
Or inline before loading scripts:
```html
<script>window.API_BASE_URL='https://casino-backend.example/api';</script>
```

## 🚀 Quick Start (Local Full Stack)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ashish1133/Money-Plant-Casino.git
cd Money-Plant-Casino
cp .env.example .env   # edit secrets, origins
cd server
npm install            # install backend dependencies
node server.js         # starts API on :3000
```
Open `index.html` directly (or serve with VS Code Live Server / simple HTTP) — API calls hit `http://localhost:3000/api`.

### Docker
```bash
docker compose up --build -d
```
Backend: `http://localhost:3000/api` (static frontend also served). The dynamic base picks same-origin `/api` when accessed through the container host mapping.

### Environment Variables (`.env`)
| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `PORT` | Backend port (default 3000) |
| `CORS_ORIGINS` | Comma-separated allowed origins (frontend URLs) |
| `JWT_ACCESS_SECRET` / `JWT_REFRESH_SECRET` | Long random secrets for signing tokens |
| `SQLITE_DB_PATH` | Path to DB file (e.g. `./data/casino.db`) |
| `ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRY` | e.g. `15m` |
| `REFRESH_TOKEN_EXPIRY` | e.g. `7d` |

### Multi-Origin CORS
Set `CORS_ORIGINS=https://casino.example,https://pages.example` to allow both deployments. Requests from other origins are rejected.

- Each game has different odds and strategies
- Have fun and play responsibly!

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Frontend: HTML5 / CSS3 / Vanilla JS
- Backend: Node.js + Express + better-sqlite3
- Auth: JWT (access + refresh) with secure rotation
- RNG: Seed + hash for provable fairness
- Logging: Winston
- Rate limiting: `express-rate-limit`
- Docker / Compose for containerized deployment

## 📝 Notes & Disclaimers
- Entertainment / demo only – no real gambling.
- RNG & fairness logic provided for educational purposes.
- Replace secrets in production; never commit real JWT keys.
- Configure HTTPS + secure cookie flags if extending auth scope.
- Implement KYC / AML / responsible gaming features for any real deployment.

## 🎨 Customization
Edit:
- Theme tokens in `styles.css` (`:root` variables)
- Game math & payouts in `server/services/gameService.js`
- Progression thresholds in `progressionService.js`
- Achievements definitions in corresponding service (extend criteria)
- Frontend animations / cards / metrics in `script.js`

Add new game: create service + route under `server/services` & `server/routes`, expose endpoint, integrate UI modal.

## ✅ Deployment Checklist
1. Set real JWT secrets in `.env`
2. Configure `CORS_ORIGINS` with final frontend domains
3. Persist SQLite `./data` directory (volume in Docker)
4. Add automated backups / migrations if scaling
5. Serve over HTTPS (reverse proxy: Nginx / Caddy / cloud host)
6. Monitor logs (stdout aggregation or external service)
7. Optionally add CI for lint/test & tagging releases
